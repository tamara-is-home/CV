Difficulties, that I've encountered and how I fight them:


1. Its way harder to properly set up ENV for computer vision task than I thought. Colab didnt work fine for me as some
methods resufed to work there + a lot of troubles with different packages versions. I've tried using PyCharm on Macos,
however there also were some troubles caused by some pre-installed OpenCv libraries that were in conflict with the ones


I wanted to use. I ended up using PyCharm on WIndows and creating venv for project, installing only those things that I need.
2. Some methods like SIFT or SURF refused to work. As far as I got it, they're not free in open cv, but one can use them with
open-cv contrib. Still didnt work for me - even obj creation like SIFT_create() returned an error. Had to use other methods tho


3. I've made a basic detector-descriptor-match-RANSAC pipeline and tested it on 3 different descriptors that Im using
in my MODS. While ORB and BRISK works fine (at least they are able to easily match same image rotated by 45`), MSER performs really
bad. The amount of keypoint found my MSER is the biggest, but there's only a few which can match well. I guess the trouble
here might be that there's no descriptor for MSER, but only detector, thus I had to use ORB as descriptor.
If you run utils.py you'll see what Im saying.

4. When generating affine view of images, some images with black angles (e.g. after rotation) may be smeared is some really bad way.
However, it doesnt affect point detection thus dont create problems

5. Default parameters aint the best one to detect kp in some really angeled view. I've tried to find the best parameters by
running multple loops (like in a sklearn's GridSearch) but ended up that the default ones performs the same as mine super-adjusted -_-

6. Some stuff that is mentioned in MODS paper aint implemented in opencv, so had to use more plain analogs.
